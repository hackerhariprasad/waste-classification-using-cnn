# waste-classification-using-cnn
Developed a machine learning solution utilizing Python, Kera's, TensorFlow, and OpenCV to identify in images,
for automatic waste classification methods.
Engineered and trained a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on a categorized dataset, resulting in the model
distinguishing between different categories of wastes.
Gained expertise in designing and implementing CNN architectures for specialized image classification tasks,
emphasizing waste classification.
This process can help improve easy to sort and recycling efforts and reduce environmental impact
